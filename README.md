# Simple Books API – Postman Collection

A complete Postman collection for testing and exploring the **Simple Books API** – a RESTful API for browsing books and managing orders. This collection doubles as both a reference guide and an end-to-end workflow test suite.

## Overview

The **Simple Books API** allows clients to:

- Check the health/status of the API
- Register as an API client to obtain an access token
- Browse a catalogue of books (fiction and non-fiction)
- Place, retrieve, update, and delete book orders

**Base URL:** `https://simple-books-api.click`

This collection is structured as an **end-to-end workflow** – requests are ordered to be run sequentially. Each request builds on the previous one, 
with test scripts that automatically capture values (e.g. `bookId`, `orderId`) into collection variables for use in subsequent requests.

---

## Prerequisites & Setup

### 1. Import the Collection

Import the collection into Postman via **File → Import** or by using the Postman link shared with you.

### 2. Set the Base URL

The `baseUrl` collection variable is pre-configured to:

```
https://simple-books-api.click
```

### 3. Register as an API Client

Before placing orders, you must register as an API client to receive an **access token**. Send the **Register API Client** request – (see [API Clients](#api-clients) below). The token returned should be stored in the `accessToken` collection variable.

## Authentication

Most read operations (checking status, listing books) are **unauthenticated**. However, all **order management** endpoints require a Bearer token.

### Obtaining a Token

Send a `POST` request to `/api-clients` with your client details:

```http
POST {{baseUrl}}/api-clients
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "clientName": "Your Name",
  "clientEmail": "your@email.com"
}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "accessToken": "your-access-token-here"
}
```

### Using the Token

Include the token in the `Authorization` header for all order-related requests:

```http
Authorization: Bearer Token {{accessToken}}
```

> **Note:** Each email address can only be registered once. If you receive a `"API client already registered.  Try a different email."` error, use a different email address or retrieve your existing token.

Store the token in the `accessToken` collection variable so all requests can reference it automatically via `{{accessToken}}`.

| `orderId`      | ID of the created order (set automatically by tests)                       | `PF6MflPDcuhWobZcgmJy5`                |
| `customerName` | Name of the customer placing the order (set automatically by tests)        | `John Doe`                             |

## Example Workflows

### End-to-End Order Workflow

This is the primary workflow the collection is designed to demonstrate. Run all requests **in order** using the Collection Runner:

```
1.  GET  /status                    → Verify API is online
2.  POST /api-clients               → Registers new user
3.  GET  /books                     → Find an available book
4.  GET  /books/:bookId             → Confirm book details
5.  POST /orders                    → Place an order
6.  GET  /orders                    → Verify order appears in list
7.  GET  /orders/:orderId           → Retrieve the specific order
8.  PATCH /orders/:orderId          → Update the customer name
9.  GET  /orders/:orderId           → Verify the name was updated
10. DELETE /orders/:orderId         → Delete the order
11. GET  /orders/:orderId           → Verify the order is gone
12. DELETE /orders/:orderId         → Triggers "No order with id" error
13. POST /api-clients               → Triggers "API client already registered" error
```

### Quick Book Browse (No Auth Required)

```
1. GET /status
2. GET /books?type=fiction
3. GET /books/:bookId
```

## Running the Collection

### Option 1: Collection Runner (Manual)

1. Open the [Simple Books API](collection/17318486-9a7cbdad-23ba-4797-ae5c-59bbf3206fe7) collection in Postman
2. Click **Run collection**
3. Ensure all 13 requests are selected and in order
4. Click **Run Simple Books API**

### Option 2: Postman CLI (CI/CD)

```bash
# Install the Postman CLI
curl -o- "https://dl-cli.pstmn.io/install.sh" | sh

# Login
postman login --with-api-key YOUR_POSTMAN_API_KEY

# Run the collection
postman collection run 17318486-9a7cbdad-23ba-4797-ae5c-59bbf3206fe7
```

### Option 3: Scheduled Monitor

Set up a Postman Monitor to run this collection on a schedule for continuous API health monitoring:

1. In the collection, click **...** → **Monitor collection**
2. Set your desired schedule (e.g. every hour)
3. Postman will alert you if any tests fail

## Notes

- The API is hosted on [Glitch](https://glitch.me) and may have a **cold start delay** of a few seconds if it hasn't been accessed recently.
- The `bookId`, `orderId`, and `customerName` variables are set automatically by test scripts – you do not need to set them manually when running the full workflow.
- Orders are scoped to your `accessToken` – you can only view and manage orders created with your own token.
